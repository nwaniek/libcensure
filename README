C99 Implementation of the Center Surround Extremas, described in [1]. The purpos
of this library is to provide an implementation of CenSurE without the need for
a huge library like OpenCV. libcensure concentrates exclusively on one algorithm
and its implementation. Though the main goal was not to have the fastest
implementation but a working one that is easy to use, speed improvements may be
made in future releases.


Installation Instructions

To install the library, run make and copy src/libcensure.h and the resulting
libcensure.so to the appropriate places. In a future version, a make install
target might be provided.
